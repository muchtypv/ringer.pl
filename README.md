# ringer.pl
Perl script and libraries for practising change ringing methods using a keyboard.

None of this is going to make sense unless you are a bellringer who knows about change ringing.

This is code I wrote a long, long time ago when I wanted something to get my teeth stuck into while learning perl.

I also wanted a program that would allow me to practice methods and compositions on the computer keyboard at a much faster pace than real-time software such as abel allows.

The idea is that you input your composition and then you "ring" it using the arrow keys on the keyboard:
left = hunt down for a blow
right = hunt up for a blow
down = make a place

So basically you trace the blue line of your bell through the composition as quickly as you can type (peal speed can be around 15 mins!)

If you press the correct arrow key the next change is displayed, if you press the wrong one the message "ouch" is printed and you need to try that change again.

There are more instructions at this link: http://tinyurl.com/ringer-pl  (I know it really ought to be a markdown file in this project)

There are lots of great options in the document.

I apologise that there is very little validation of input - I never intended the world to use this!

Glees:
- It does exactly what I wanted it to do at the time
- You can ring touches/peals of spliced (I'm currently revising smiths 23-spiced using it)

Gripes:
- It does only what I wanted it to do at the time
- no input validation as previously mentioned
- it only does 4ths place calls
- it only does calls at the lead end
- Stedman?  Forget it!

Good luck

Peter
